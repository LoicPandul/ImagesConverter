# ImagesConverter

ImagesConverter is a simple Python GUI application designed for converting images between different formats via drag-and-drop. It's not an incredible software, but it's a small tool I made for myself to increase productivity, and if it can be useful to you as well, all the better! I will try to improve the software over time.

## Features

Easily convert your images with a simple drag-and-drop into formats:
- JPEG;
- WEBP;
- PNG.

Superfluous metadata from your images is automatically removed during conversion.
